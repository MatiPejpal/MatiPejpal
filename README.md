Hi, Iâ€™m @MatiPejpal.   
- I am 18 years old, and programming is my hobby.  
- Java is the language that I am most familiar with, but I also know basics of python.
- I've been interested in programming since I was 13 years old. (then I was playing with html and css)
- My native language is Polish, but I can speak some English.
- I am little busy right with this whole studying thing.
